# PORTFOLIO PREP

## Tell me about yourself:


### A two or three word catchy title.

Future software developer.


### A personal headline. What do you want your career to be about?

Aspiring software developer. I want to do my bit in the tech world and contribute to make a better world.


### Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.

My name is Araceli Garcia and I have a background in Hospitality and Hotel Management. However, about a year ago I got a job at a tech oriented company and being surrounded by so many tech professionals has made me want to be part of the vibrant and ever evolving tech community. Technology is almost everywhere nowadays and will conquer all industries in the upcoming years, so from a pragmatic point of view, it is a great career path to take. From a ‘passion’ point of view, new technologies are emerging on a weekly basis and it is amazing what the human being is accomplishing and, to be honest, I want to be a part of it and contribute to it somehow. I don’t fit into the stereotypical tech profile as I have always held customer-oriented positions, but I would say that is my biggest strength: I feel as comfortable behind the laptop as interacting with the customer.


### What excites you the most about tech?

That it is a changing and ever evolving industry that requires for you to continue to learn and expand your knowledge. As a tech worker your job requirements will continue to change as new languages, libraries or procedures evolve, therefore it will feel somehow new as time goes by.
